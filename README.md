# Wallet

## Description

This app runs at the root address.

Create a new entry by clicking "New expense". Fill the "amount" field with a dollar amount (positive for money gained, and negative for expenses) and a short descriptor of the debit/credit in the "description" field.

The running total of the account is displayed at the end of the table, along with the total number of transactions so far, and a warning message if the account is overdrawn.
